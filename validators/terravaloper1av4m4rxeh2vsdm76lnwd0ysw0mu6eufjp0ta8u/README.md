# Nexus Event (INACTIVE)

We have all been drastically impacted by the depegging, but we are proud to say that we are validating on the new phoenix-1 chain! If you're interested in getting huge rewards on your airdrops, please consider us when looking to stake with: terravaloper1ltn4ah8k5a2alm9ekgf0e90zmt26kq6nztzatm

Nexus Event, the event which causes a new timeline to arise from the "sacred timeline." This is your chance as a variant to disrupt the status quo and break the shackles of the centralized economy. Join us and become one of the variants who will bring dApps to your common man.

## Team

We might not have a deep bench, but we strive for exceptionalism.

## Our Architecture

Think multi-national corporation cloud hosting solution. If it goes down, the world is probably ending.

## Ecosystem Contributions

We're in it for the long haul and have the bills to prove it from the pre-Columbus 5 days. 

We hope to keep comissions low and pass along the savings to you.
